# Foundry DeFi Stablecoin

<br>

 ## Stablecoin

 - A stablecoin is a digital token whose price stays stable (doesn't go up/down wildly like Bitcoin or Ethereum).

 ### 🔗 Why Are They Used?


🔄 Acts as a medium of exchange without volatility.

🛒 Used for buying goods/services with crypto.

📉 Helpful in DeFi apps for lending/borrowing without risk of big price swings.

## 💸 What is a DeFi App?

DeFi (Decentralized Finance) app is a smart contract-based financial app built on blockchain (like Ethereum), with no middlemen like banks.

**It lets users:**

- 🚀 Lend and borrow crypto

- 💰 Earn interest

- 🪙 Mint or burn stablecoins

- ⚖️ Trade tokens directly

- 💎 Provide liquidity

 ✅ Everything is automated using smart contracts.

 ## 🪙 Minting a Coin (Token Minting)

**Minting refers to the process of creating new tokens and adding them to the total supply, typically in exchange for depositing collateral or fulfilling some predefined condition in a smart contract.**

- Example in DeFi: When a user deposits ETH into a vault, the protocol mints new stablecoins (e.g. DAI or DSC) and gives them to the user.

## 🔥 Burning a Coin (Token Burning)

**Burning refers to the process of permanently removing tokens from circulation, reducing the total supply. This is usually done by sending tokens to an unspendable address or calling a burn function.**

- Example in DeFi: A user returns (repays) stablecoins to the protocol, which then burns them and unlocks the collateral.

## ⚠️ Liquidation

**Liquidation is the process of forcibly selling or seizing a user's collateral when the value of their collateral falls below a required threshold, in order to maintain the stability and solvency of the system.**

- Example in DeFi: If the price of ETH drops and a user's loan is undercollateralized, the protocol allows others to repay part of their debt and receive their ETH at a discount.
